What is HDFS and how it works ?

Git clone this link in  your terminal : https://github.com/Marcel-Jan/docker-hadoop-spark

To validate this challenge you will have to validate the following commands (Please read the commands docs first):

In the Hadoop cluster from Hortonworks or EMR what is the default block size?
Download this file  Pokemon - Datase and copy it into HDFS in a folder called pekemon-data
Usge "fsck command" to print the block storage detail for the pokemon file
Accroding to the size from the last request, what is the size of the file and the replication number
